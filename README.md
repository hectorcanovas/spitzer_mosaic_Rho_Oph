# Create RGB image of the Rho-Oph SFR from Spizer/IRAC mosaics

* Purpose: Combine Spizer/IRAC mosaics to create an infrared color image of the Rho-Ophiuchus Star Forming Region (SFR)
* Methods: IDL/Pyhon (Public & personal tools).
* Input data: Spitzer/IRAC mosaics downloaded from: https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPITZER/C2D/images/OPH/MOSAICS:
  * OPH_ALL_COMB_IRAC1_mosaic.fits (628M)
  * OPH_ALL_COMB_IRAC2_mosaic.fits (629M)
  * OPH_ALL_COMB_IRAC4_mosaic.fits (624M)
* Results: Fig.1 published in first ODISEA paper (Cieza et al. 2018 at http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.482..698C)
